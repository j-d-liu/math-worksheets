# ✏️ Free math worksheet creator

I created this tool because I couldn't find a simple, ad-free math worksheet generator for my daughter. Most existing websites were either cluttered with ads, required a subscription, or had messy print layouts that wasted paper.

This project was built to solve a real-world parenting pain point—focused on **alignment**, **simplicity**, and **perfect A4 printing**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Clean Layout:** Problems are perfectly aligned in columns, making them easy for kids to read and solve.
* **A4 Optimized:** Designed specifically to fit 20, 40, or 60 questions on a single page with professional margins and Safari-safe print logic.
* **Privacy First:** No login, no tracking, and no ads. Everything runs locally in the browser.
* **Customizable:** Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division with adjustable difficulty levels.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Open the [Live Demo](https://j-d-liu.github.io/math-worksheets/).
2.  Select the number of questions and the operations you want.
3.  Click **Generate & Print**.
4.  In the print dialog, ensure **Margins** are set to **"Default"** or **"None"** for the best result.
